Experience is a good school.
But the fees are high.
When words leave off, music begins.
I will not say that women have no character;
rather, they have a new one every day.
Where they have burned books,
they will end in burning human beings.
If the Romans had been obliged to learn Latin,
they would never have found time to conquer the world.
